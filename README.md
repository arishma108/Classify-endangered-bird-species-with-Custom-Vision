# Classify-endangered-bird-species-with-Custom-Vision
Ornithologists study the behavior, physiology, and conservation of birds and bird habitat. Their work often involves surveying, recording, and reporting on bird activity.  Build a machine learning model that will identify a bird in an image by species, to help with gathering data.  In this project I use Azure Cognitive Services Custom Vision to create a model to identify species of birds!
